# user flow

## entry point
- The user **opens the app**.
- They are greeted with a **welcome message**
- No login required (for now) → the app is open to use immediately.

---

## step 1: mood check-in
- The app asks: **"How are you feeling?"**
- User selects a mood from:  
  - Happy  
  - Calm  
  - Anxious  
  - Sad  
**→ Possible User Choices:**
- Proceed to mindfulness suggestion  
- Exit after check-in  

---

## step 2: AI- powered practice suggestion
- The app sends the mood (and optional body/mind note) to an **AI wrapper** (OpenAI or Claude).
- The AI returns a mindfulness practice and a journal prompt, selected from a pre-tagged internal dataset.
  - Example suggestions:  
    - **Happy → Gratitude reflection**  
    - **Calm → Breath awareness practice**  
    - **Anxious → Grounding yoga pose**  
    - **Sad → Self-compassion meditation**  
    
**→ Possible User Choices:**
- Proceed to journaling  
- Exit after the practice  

---

## step 3: journal prompt
- The app displays a **journaling prompt** chosen or generated by AI based on mood.
- The user can reflect and write in a textbox (or skip this step).

**→ Possible User Choices:**
- Write and save the journal response  
- Skip and finish the session  

---

## step 4: session complete
- The app thanks the user for checking in.
- It **logs the session** (if user login is enabled).
- The user may return to home or exit the app.

### notes:
- **Feedback will eventually be collected** (emoji/rating) after journal reflection to help personalize future suggestions.
- **AI personalization** will improve over time with more mood and feedback data.
