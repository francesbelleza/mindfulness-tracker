# Mindfulness Track App

### about the project:
Mindfulness Tracker is a simple, intuitive app designed to support others 
take a moment to check in with themselves. 

It provides:
- A **mood check-in** to reflect on emotions
- A **mindfulness or yoga exercise** for grounding
- A **journaling prompt** for deeper self-reflection
